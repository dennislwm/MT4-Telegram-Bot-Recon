# About MT4-Telegram-Bot-Recon
[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) isn't just for sending and receiving chat messages. It's also for automating your dialog flow, including work flow. Using a Telegram Bot gives you the ability to check prices, query status, manage trades, and even have a fun conversation. And if you're a serious crypto or forex trader, you can create your own Telegram Bot to manage your order flow.

MT4-Telegram-Bot-Recon is an Expert Advisor that communicates with a Telegram Bot. You can use the Bot to query your orders from a Metatrader 4 ["MT4"] client. You can use this approach to manage your order flow, view account details, open and close orders, or even broadcast trade signals to a Telegram group or channel.


# How to Create a New Telegram Bot
* Search for a bot on telegram with name "@BotFather". We will find it through the search engine. After adding it to the list of contacts,
we will start communicating with it using the /start command. As a response it will send you a list of all available commands, As shown in the image below

* With the /newbot command we begin the registration of a new bot. We need to come up with two names. The first one is a name of a bot that 
can be set in your native language. The second one is a username of a bot in Latin that ends with a “bot” prefix. As a result, we obtain 
a token or API Key – the access key for operating with a bot through API as shown below

## Operation mode for bots

With regard to bots, you can let them join groups by using the /setjoingroups command. If a bot is added to a group, then by using the /setprivacy command you can set the option to either receive all messages, or only those that start with a sign of the symbol team “/”.

The other mode focuses on operation on a channel. Telegram channels are accounts for transmitting messages for a wide audience that support an unlimited number of subscribers. The important feature of channels is that users can't leave comments and likes on the news feed (one-way connection). Only channel administrators can create messages there

## Configuration of MT4 Client
